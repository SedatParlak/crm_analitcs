# Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

## Customer Segmentation with Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Business Problem: There is an e-commerce company, and this company wants to segment its customers to develop a marketing strategy. In this project, I used to CLV for customer segmentations. Customer lifetime value (CLV) is one of the key stats to track as part of a customer experience program. CLV is a measurement of how valuable a customer is to your company, not just on a purchase-by-purchase basis but across the whole relationship.


Calculation CLTV Parameters :

CLTV = (Customer Value / Churn Rate) x Profit Margin

Customer Value = Average Order Value x Purchase Frequency

Average Order Value = Total Price / Total Transaction

Purchase Frequency = Total Transaction / Total Number of Customer

Churn Rate = 1 - Repeat Rate(Retention Rate)

Profit Margin = Total Price x Profit
