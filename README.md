## Customer Segmentation with RFM

Business Problem: There is an e-commerce company, and this company wants to segment its customers to develop a marketing strategy. In this project, I used to RFM metrics for customer segmentations. There are three metrics Recency, Frequency and Monetary. Here is the definition of RFM metrics :

Recency: how long ago they made a purchase. Frequency: how often they make purchases. Monetary: how much money they spend.

I cleaned and analyzed the customers' data, segmented the customer using RFM, and functionalized the entire process.
